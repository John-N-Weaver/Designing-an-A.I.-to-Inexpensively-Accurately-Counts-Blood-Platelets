# Designing-an-A.I.-to-Inexpensively-Accurately-Counts-Blood-Platelets  (John Weaver, Chris Ayala, Brian Van Vlymen)

A physician friend of mine was complaining about the cost of medical devices that perform platelet counts, easily $20,000 and up.  I suggested that why couldn't that be done with a simple Raspberry Pi and digital microscope.  That off the cuff remark lead me to actually pondering "Is this truly possible?".  

Coincidentally, I was enrolled in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and had a group project requirement for the course.  I teamed up with Brian van Vlymen and Chris Ayala to create the included content.  

This is a work in progress; expect some errors, some humor, and some science.  Hopefully, we will be uploading a working prototype soon.  

Thank you for looking at our site and feel free to leave feedback, suggestions, and ideas for improvement.
