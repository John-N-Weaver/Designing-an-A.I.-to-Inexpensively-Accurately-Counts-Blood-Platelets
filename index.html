  <h3 class="read">A physician friend of mine was complaining about the cost of medical devices that perform platelet counts, easily $20,000 and up. I suggested that why couldn't that be done with a simple Raspberry Pi and digital microscope. That off the cuff remark lead me to actually pondering "Is this truly possible?".
        Coincidentally, I was enrolled in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and had a group project requirement for the course. I teamed up with Brian van Vlymen and Chris Ayala to create the included content.
        This is a work in progress; expect some errors, some humor, and some science. Hopefully, we will be uploading a working prototype soon.
        Thank you for looking at our site and feel free to leave feedback, suggestions, and ideas for improvement.</h3>
